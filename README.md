# Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming - e-Portfolio

This repository contains my e-Portfolio for the Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming module.

The e-Portfolio presents a curated collection of artefacts developed throughout the module, demonstrating my understanding and application of advanced object-oriented principles, secure coding practices, design patterns, and scalable software architecture. Collectively, these artefacts form a capstone-style body of work reflecting my learning journey across the module.

## Portfolio Structure

- artefacts/
  - Coding exercises demonstrating advanced object-oriented programming and secure design
  - Case studies exploring software architecture, security, AI, and data science considerations
  - Capstone project artefacts illustrating design evolution and architectural decision-making

- reflections/
  - Reflective commentary linking artefacts to module learning outcomes
  - Capstone overview and design rationale

Each artefact includes a brief description outlining its purpose, the object-oriented principles applied, challenges encountered, and how it demonstrates advanced object-oriented design and programming concepts.
