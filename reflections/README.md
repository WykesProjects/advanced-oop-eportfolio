# Reflections

This section contains reflective commentary on my learning and development throughout the Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming module.

The reflections critically evaluate how the artefacts included in this e-Portfolio demonstrate achievement of the module learning outcomes, including the application of advanced object-oriented principles, secure coding practices, design patterns, and scalable software architecture. Emphasis is placed on analysing design decisions, trade-offs, and areas of improvement rather than simply describing outcomes.

This section also includes reflection on academic and employability skill development, such as critical thinking, problem-solving, research and self-study, time management, and professional communication. In addition, it incorporates a Professional Development Plan outlining strengths, areas for improvement, and future development goals informed by my performance in this module.
