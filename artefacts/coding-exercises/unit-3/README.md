# Unit 3 – Formative Coding Exercise

## Purpose of the Artefact
This artefact was developed as part of the Unit 3 formative task and focuses on applying advanced object-oriented programming concepts to solve a defined software problem.

## Object-Oriented Principles and Techniques
This exercise applies key object-oriented principles, including encapsulation and separation of responsibilities, to improve code clarity, maintainability, and robustness.

## Challenges and Resolutions
During development, several design and implementation challenges were encountered, particularly in relation to structuring responsibilities and maintaining clean interactions between components. These challenges were addressed through iterative refactoring and improved abstraction.

## Demonstration of Advanced OOP Concepts
This artefact demonstrates an understanding of advanced object-oriented design by applying structured design decisions, refactoring for maintainability, and aligning implementation choices with best practices discussed throughout the module.
