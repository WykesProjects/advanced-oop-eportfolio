# Capstone Project

This section presents the capstone-style body of work developed for the Advanced Object-Oriented Design and Programming module.

The capstone brings together selected artefacts from across the module to demonstrate the application of advanced object-oriented design principles in the context of secure, maintainable, and scalable software systems. Rather than focusing on a single large application, the capstone reflects a coherent design narrative that emphasises design evolution, architectural decision-making, and the practical application of object-oriented theory.

The artefacts included in this section address common challenges encountered in complex software systems, such as maintaining thread safety, enforcing clear separation of responsibilities, and designing components that are extensible and resilient to change. Design patterns and abstraction techniques are applied to improve maintainability, reduce coupling, and support future extensibility.

Each artefact in this section is accompanied by a description outlining:
- The problem being addressed
- Key design and architectural decisions
- Object-oriented principles and patterns applied
- Challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- How the artefact contributes to the overall capstone narrative
