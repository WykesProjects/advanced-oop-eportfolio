# Case Studies

This section contains case studies developed during the module that explore advanced topics in software design, security, artificial intelligence, and data science.

The case studies focus on analysing real-world or realistic software scenarios to examine how object-oriented design principles, architectural decisions, and secure coding practices influence system quality, scalability, and robustness. Emphasis is placed on evaluating design trade-offs, identifying potential weaknesses, and considering alternative approaches.

Each case study in this section includes a brief description outlining:
- The context and purpose of the case study
- Key design, security, or architectural considerations explored
- Relevant object-oriented principles and patterns
- Insights gained from analysing the scenario
- How the case study contributed to my understanding of advanced object-oriented design and programming
